        <h1>What is Help4TheHomeless?</h1>
                Help4TheHomeless is a nonprofit organization in which volunteers around the New York City area help out the homeless. When you are homeless, a simple smile and a word of kindness can make a big difference in a day full of hardship. Our website allows people from all over the country to help the homeless by donating or volunteering to give out money, clothing, and shoes, etc., that has been donated, to the homeless. We also provide services that meet their immediate needs and potentially transform their lives from poverty and hopelessness to hope. By helping the homeless as a member 
                Help4TheHomless, we see the amount of homeless people diminish. We find the them in the cities, in suburbs, under bridges, in parks, and on vacant industrial property. They live in tents, plywood and tarp contraptions that defy defintion. Some oof the homless do work. some have substance-abuse problems. Some suffer from some form of mental illness. Every one of them want to feel what the rest of us want as well, love and understanding.<br>

                3. Ending homelessness strengthens the health and wellbeing of our communities.<br>
        <br>
                    When people are assisted to move back into a safe and secure home their mental and physical health improves and people often reconnect with employment, health services, education and community. Young people reconnect with family and re-engage with school.
                    <br>
                    Appropriate housing boosts recovery and keeps people safe and healthy when making the transition from healthcare and mental health facilities. It contributes to successful outcomes for young people leaving care and enhances community re-integration for people leaving prison, preventing re-offending and re-incarceration.
                    <br>
                    People become healthier and more stable in a safe home, which results in declining costs of frequent admissions to health and crisis services, as well as correctional and mental health facilitates. This cuts taxpayer costs on mainstream services and lightens pressure on already stressed systems.
